Owasp Seasides is organized in GOA on Last week of 2019-February, it’s an amazing conference of Premium workshops and Bug bounty track and Tool exhibition and Talks on different sections of Info-sec and I had an opportunity to attend With a Scholarship offer From OwaspSeasides.

Thanks to all the OwaspSeasides Community people and OwaspSeasides Sponsors With out their help I couldn’t make it.

# [](#header-1)Car Hacking !

The Workshop Which I Attended is Reversing and Exploitation of Vehicle (CAR Hacking) on 28th February 2019, Taken by Arun Mane Sir, Which is a premium Workshop of Owasp Seasides I thought of attending this workshop will make me clear in basics of CAN and I can go more in Vehicle hacking field, but I am surprised by the way Arun sir and Nikhil Sir took it which made me so clear not only about the basics and even Typical Vehicle networks In real life application.

Arun sir shared a car.ova file which is configured with CAN-utils and a virtual Simulation tool of Car’s Speedometer and a controller interface Which gives an experience of taking remote control of a vehicle.
There was an exercise to increase the speed of the vehicle by sending a can send a signal to the CAN interface of the virtual vehicle.

Lunch which was free for all the attendees was too good desi food I felt like it’s my home food.
After lunch, I had an opportunity to see a live attack Demonstration on car hacking, Which basically connecting mechanically to the car and send the spoofing signal to Direction indicators which I am lucky to get experience by sitting in the back seat of the car.


After that, we had Some more brainstorming Details how we can literally remote control a car and Several other possible vulnerabilities which anyone with basic knowledge of this can exploit.

And the evening talks from experts on Infosec industry was too good which consists of many platforms. I personally liked
Panel Discussion – Entrepreneurs in the cybersecurity business.
Panelists:-
Rahul Sasi – Founder at Cloudsek.
Ricky Rajkumar – Founder at IntouchWorld.
Mark Felegyhazi – CEO at Avatao .
Panel Moderator:-
Ajit Hatti – Founder at Pureid.
Talk on Car Hacking Nowadays by Henrik Noelscher.
Talk on Building Your Hacker BlackBox for Fun And Profit by vanshit Malhotra.
Talk on Mallory in a Modern World: Practical exploitation of IoT systems
by attacking Wireless Sensor Networks by Sunil Kumar S.

And the Owasp party is the perfect place for Meeting Infosec Legends and making new friends, Networking, having a discussion of your ideas with others and getting great exposure to the community.

I still regret that I couldn’t attend the Red team village, Due to some traveling issues.

And All over The JOSH was at it’s HIGH!!!!!!
